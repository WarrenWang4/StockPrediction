# StockPrediction - EECS 731
### Overall Project Description
The overall goal of this project is to derive insights and conclusions regarding the price of FAANG stocks. To do this, we look at two different models for forecasting closing prices of stocks. The two models we picked were LSTM and Prophet. We also take a look at the trend of FAANG closing stock prices, historical price to earnings ratios, and attempt to find historical correlations between the highest and lowest percent earning days for each FAANG company.
